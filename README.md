Notes from Sir Wil:

Submit your finals here. Here are a couple of reminders:

1. Do not commit compiler or IDE-generated files (the *.o, *.pdb among others)
2. Documentation, especially on how to build and play the game, is appreciated.
3. Also commit a PDF version of the [Certificate of Authorship for groups](http://www.admu.edu.ph/ls/sose/iscs/downloads).
